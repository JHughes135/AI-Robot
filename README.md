# AI, Robot
The goal of this project is to try to implement Isaac Asimov’s 3 Laws of robotics within Unity. The area of AI and ethics is a hot topic recently and there is still uncertainty about the safety of putting human life in the hands of AI. Asimov’s 3 laws are a basis for safe AI 

The three laws are:

1.	A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2.	A robot must obey any orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3.	A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

I will determine the best way to implement these laws, whether through machine learning or a rules based approach. The simulation will consist of a robot within an environment containing humans and dangers to the robot itself and the humans. The aim will be for the robot to follow the three laws to their best ability. Along with this I will also have to establish a way to measure harm to the humans.
